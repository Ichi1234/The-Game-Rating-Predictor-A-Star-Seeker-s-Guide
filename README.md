# The Game Rating Predictor A Star Seeker's Guide
This project is my year 1 final project for the Programming II course at Kasetsart University.
The reason why I made this project is I want to make a program that is a platform for Game Developers to discuss and share their ideas to make their game better and achieve higher score ratings from players.<br/>

# Main Features
 * **See the statistics of each game**
      - **The user can see the relationship between each factor that affects the Rating score.**
 
      - **The user can create a graph to see the relationship between other factors.**
 
 
 * **See the data of 20000++ games**
     - **The user can select the game's title to see the data of that game. For example, Rating Score, Total Players, Summary of the game.**
 
 
* **Talk with each other**
    - **The users can create a forum to ask or give their ideas to other game developers.**
